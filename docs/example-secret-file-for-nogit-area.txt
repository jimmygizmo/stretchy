# EXAMPLE: secret-rpagent.txt

# This example secret file is included here so you can read these important notes below.
# Please do read them so you understand how automation works in this project and about security/repo best practices.


# IMPORTANT:
# 1. The source/original file for this file (or similar files) lives inside /nogit/
# 2. Automation copies such a file into the needed subfolder, usually for a build.
# 3. Entries in .gitignore prevent any such file (or anything under /nogit/) from entering the repo.
# 4. Entries in .gitignore prevent the copy of this file in its automation-target subdir, from entering the repo.
# 5. This is part of one of a few mechanisms which keep secrets, configs and very large files OUT of the repo.


# EXAMPLE OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE secret-rpagent.txt DUMMY SECRET FILE:
# This is currently a dummy file. It illustrates the automation phase of preparing to build, in which files which
# are maintained outside of the app strcture and/or outside of the project (like secrets, among many other types)
# and then copied in to the main app/build directories. This automation is in place and operating, in case it is
# needed, such as for copying in secrets or other content like web content, needed for a build.
